# Leonardo Pohl - A person of Intrest

Hi my name is Leonardo Pohl. I am currently studying Computer Science Msc at Leiden Universiteit

## Projects

### Drone Project

#### Continuous to Discrete Space Transformation

### Procedural Map Generation

Even though it is not my main occupancy and probably never wil be, I am enjoying video editing. One example that really shows my interest is a video I have edited for Multimedia Systems.
